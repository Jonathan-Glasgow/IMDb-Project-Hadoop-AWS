# IMDb-Project-Hadoop-AWS
A project where I created and utilized a Hadoop Multi-node cluster through AWS to filter, sort, and analyze IMDb movie data.

Setup of the cluster is described in "Hadoop Multi-Node Cluster Setup with AWS". 
Filtering, sorting, and analysis of data described in "Analysis of IMDb Movie Data using an AWS EMR Cluster".
